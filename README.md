Potential trainees can easily search for a training by browsing different opportunities in a specific field or by searching for a specific title or even a location for the training. They can also apply for any opportunity simply by filling a form and submitting it through the app.  Users will get notified if their application is accepted or rejected.   On the other hand, companies can also announce for available training programs by filling out an application that contains all details about the training. A number of applications from different applicants is sent to the company to choose from.
